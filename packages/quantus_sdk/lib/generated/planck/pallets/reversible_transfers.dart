  ///
  /// **Enabling high security mode is a one-way operation that cannot be undone.**

  /// Once this function is called successfully, the account is permanently restricted

  /// - [`schedule_transfer`](Self::schedule_transfer) - Schedule delayed native token
  ///  transfers
  /// - [`cancel`](Self::cancel) - Cancel pending transfers
  /// - [`recover_funds`](Self::recover_funds) - Guardian-initiated emergency fund recovery

  /// There is no mechanism to disable high security mode or restore normal account
  /// functionality. This design is intentional to provide maximum security guarantees:
  /// an attacker who gains access to the account cannot simply disable the protections.
